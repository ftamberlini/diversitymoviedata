# Dataset: Regional, Ethnic, and Minority Representation in Movies
This repository provides a comprehensive dataset on regional, ethnic, and minority representation in movies, designed to support research on diversity-aware recommendation systems, cultural public policies, and affirmative action analysis.

The dataset integrates movie and crew information from MovieLens, IMDb, and ANCINE, enriched with additional metadata such as original language, country of origin, budget, revenue, audience metrics, and ratings from multiple platforms (IMDb, Letterboxd, Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes). To capture sensitive cultural attributes, Large Language Models (Claude AI by Anthropic) were employed to extract ethnicity, race, gender, nationality, religion, and birthplace information for directors, screenwriters, and main characters.

Movie subtitle files were incorporated using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to identify the presence and portrayal of minority groups, including Black people, LGBTQI+ individuals, people with disabilities, and foreigners, as well as whether these groups are depicted as victims of violence.

This dataset aims to enable systematic evaluation of how recommendation systems handle cultural diversity and to provide empirical support for assessing the effectiveness of diversity-oriented cultural policies in the audiovisual sector.
